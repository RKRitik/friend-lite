Documentation    End-to-End WebSocket Streaming Transcription Tests
...
...              This test suite validates the complete transcription data flow
...              that was previously untested, which led to the end_marker bug.
...
...              Critical paths tested:
...              1. Audio → Deepgram WebSocket → Interim results (pub/sub)
...              2. Stream close → end_marker sent → CloseStream message
...              3. Deepgram → Final results → Redis stream transcription:results:{session_id}
...              4. Speech detection job → Reads Redis stream → Creates conversation
...
...              These tests would have caught the missing end_marker bug immediately.

*** Test Cases ***

WebSocket Stream Produces Final Transcripts In Redis
    [Documentation]    Verify that closing a stream triggers end_marker,
    ...                CloseStream message to Deepgram, and final results
    ...                are written to Redis stream transcription:results:{session_id}
    ...
    ...                This test directly validates the bug fix:
    ...                - Producer sends end_marker when finalizing session
    ...                - Streaming consumer detects end_marker
    ...                - Consumer sends CloseStream to Deepgram
    ...                - Deepgram returns final results (is_final=True)
    ...                - Final results written to Redis stream

Speech Detection Receives Transcription From Stream
    [Documentation]    Verify speech detection job successfully reads transcripts

    ...
    ...                This is the exact failure scenario from the bug:

    ...                - If stream is empty, returns "No transcription received"
    ...                - If stream has data, creates conversation

Word Timestamps Are Monotonically Increasing

    ...                timestamps relative to stream start. If the mock server or backend
    ...                incorrectly resets timestamps per chunk, this test will fail.
