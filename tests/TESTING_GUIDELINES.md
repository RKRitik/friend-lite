# Robot Framework Testing Guidelines

This file provides specific guidelines for organizing and writing Robot Framework tests in this project.

## Test Organization Principles

### Resource File Organization

Each resource file should have a clear purpose and contain related keywords. Resource files should include documentation explaining what types of functions belong in that file.

#### Resource File Categories

**setup_resources.robot**
- Docker service management (start/stop services)
- Environment validation
- Health checks and service dependency verification
- System preparation keywords
- Any keywords that prepare the testing environment

**session_resources.robot**
- API session creation and management
- Authentication workflows
- Token management (when needed for external tools like curl)
- Session validation and cleanup
- Keywords that handle API authentication and session state

**user_resources.robot**
- User account creation, deletion, and management
- User-related operations and utilities
- User permission validation
- Keywords specific to user account lifecycle

**integration_keywords.robot**
- Core integration workflow keywords
- File processing and upload operations
- System interaction keywords that don't fit in other categories
- Complex multi-step operations that combine multiple services

### Verification vs Setup Separation

**Verification Steps**
- **MUST be written directly in test files, not abstracted into resource keywords**
- Keep verifications close to the test logic for readability and maintainability
- Use descriptive assertion messages that explain what is being verified
- Example: `Should Be Equal As Integers    ${response.status_code}    200    Health check should return 200`
- Verification keywords should only exist in resource files if they perform complex multi-step verification that needs to be reused across multiple test suites

**Setup/Action Keywords**
- Environment setup, service management, and system actions belong in resource files
- These can be reused across multiple tests and suites
- Focus on "what to do" rather than "what to verify"
- Examples: `Get Admin API Session`, `Upload Audio File For Processing`, `Start Docker Services`

**Suite-Level Keywords**
- If a specific set of verifications needs to be repeated multiple times within a single test suite, create keywords at the suite level (in the *** Keywords *** section of the test file)
- These should be specific to that suite's testing needs
- Only create suite-level keywords when the same verification logic is used 3+ times in the same suite

## Code Style Guidelines

### Human Readability
- Tests should be readable by domain experts without deep Robot Framework knowledge
- Use descriptive keyword names that explain the business purpose
- Prefer explicit over implicit - make test intentions clear
- Use meaningful variable names and comments where helpful
- Avoid Robot Framework-specific jargon in test names and documentation

### Test Structure
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Test Name Should Describe Business Scenario
    [Documentation]    Clear explanation of what this test validates
    [Tags]            relevant    tags

    # Arrange - Setup test data and environment
    ${session}=    Get Admin API Session

    # Act - Perform the operation being tested
    ${result}=    Upload Audio File For Processing    ${session}    ${TEST_FILE}

    # Assert - Verify results directly in test (NOT in resource keywords)
    Should Be True    ${result}[successful] > 0    At least one file should be processed successfully
    Should Contain    ${result}[message]    processing completed    Processing should complete successfully
```

### Resource File Documentation
Each resource file should start with clear documentation:

```robot
*** Settings ***
Documentation    Brief description of this resource file's purpose
...
...              This file contains keywords for [specific purpose].
...              Keywords in this file should handle [what types of operations].
...
...              Examples of keywords that belong here:
...              - Keyword type 1
...              - Keyword type 2
...
...              Keywords that should NOT be in this file:
...              - Verification/assertion keywords (belong in tests)
...              - Keywords specific to other domains
```

### Authentication Pattern
- Tests should use session-based authentication via `session_resources.robot`
- Avoid passing tokens directly in tests - use sessions instead
- Extract tokens from sessions only when required for external tools (like curl)

Example:
```robot
# Good - Session-based approach
${admin_session}=    Get Admin API Session
${conversations}=    Get User Conversations    ${admin_session}

# Avoid - Direct token handling in tests
${token}=    Get Admin Token
${conversations}=    Get User Conversations    ${token}
```

## File Naming and Structure

### Test Files
- Use descriptive names that indicate the testing scope
- Example: `full_pipeline_test.robot`, `user_management_test.robot`
- Use `_test.robot` suffix for test files

### Resource Files
- Use `_resources.robot` suffix
- Name should indicate the domain: `session_resources.robot`, `user_resources.robot`

### Keywords
- Use descriptive names with clear action words
- Start with action verb when possible: `Get User Conversations`, `Upload Audio File`, `Create Test User`
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood in the domain
- Use consistent naming patterns across similar keywords

## Error Handling

### Resource Keywords
- Should handle expected error conditions gracefully
- Use appropriate Robot Framework error handling (TRY/EXCEPT blocks)
- Log meaningful error messages for debugging
- Fail fast with clear error messages when setup fails

### Test Assertions
- Write verification steps directly in tests with clear failure messages
- Use descriptive assertion messages that explain what went wrong
- Example: `Should Be Equal    ${status}    active    User should be in active status after creation`
- Include relevant context in failure messages (expected vs actual values)

## Keywords vs Inline Code

### BEFORE Writing Test Code: Check Existing Keywords

**CRITICAL: Always review existing resource files before writing any test code.**

Before implementing ANY test logic:
1. **Open and scan ALL relevant resource files** for existing keywords
2. **Read keyword documentation** to understand what they do
3. **Look for similar patterns** - if your test needs to do something common (like "create conversation", "wait for job", "send audio"), a keyword likely exists
4. **Check the keyword's dependencies** - keywords often call other helper keywords you should also use

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents code duplication and maintenance burden
- Ensures consistent test patterns across the suite
- Leverages battle-tested, optimized implementations
- Reduces test complexity and improves readability

**How to do this:**
```robot
# Bad - Writing inline code without checking
${jobs}=    Get Jobs By Type And Client    open_conversation    ${device}
${count}=    Get Length    ${jobs}
# ... manual logic to wait for new job ...

# Good - Using existing keyword
${jobs}=    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    30s    2s
...    Wait For New Job To Appear    open_conversation    ${device}    ${baseline_count}
```

**Resource Files to Check (based on your test domain):**
- `websocket_keywords.robot` - WebSocket streaming, audio chunks, conversation creation
- `conversation_keywords.robot` - Conversation CRUD, transcript operations
- `queue_keywords.robot` - Job tracking, waiting for job states, queue monitoring
- `memory_keywords.robot` - Memory operations, search, retrieval
- `audio_keywords.robot` - Audio file handling, processing
- `session_resources.robot` - Authentication, API sessions
- `integration_keywords.robot` - Complex multi-step workflows

### When to Create Keywords
- Reusable operations that are used across multiple tests or suites
- Complex multi-step setup or teardown operations
- Operations that encapsulate business logic or domain concepts
- Operations that interact with external systems (APIs, databases, files)
- **ONLY after confirming no existing keyword does what you need**

### When to Keep Code Inline
- Verification steps (assertions) - these should almost always be inline in tests
- Simple operations that are only used once
- Test-specific logic that doesn't need to be reused
- Variable assignments and simple data manipulation

## Variable and Data Management

### Test Data
- Use meaningful variable names that describe the data's purpose
- Define test data at the appropriate scope (suite variables for shared data, test variables for test-specific data)
- Store complex test data in separate variable files when it becomes large
- Use descriptive names: `${VALID_USER_EMAIL}` instead of `${EMAIL1}`

### Environment Configuration
- Load environment variables through `test_env.py`
- Use consistent variable naming across tests
- Document required environment variables and their purposes

## API Key Separation and Test Organization

### Overview

Chronicle tests are separated into two execution paths based on external API dependencies:

1. **No API Keys Required (~70% of tests)** - Run on all PRs by default
2. **API Keys Required (~30% of tests)** - Run on dev/main branches only

This separation enables:
- Fast PR validation without external API dependencies
- External contributors can run full CI without secret access
- Reduced API costs (only charged on dev/main pushes)
- Comprehensive testing still happens on protected branches

### The `requires-api-keys` Tag

**Purpose**: Mark tests that require external API services (Deepgram, OpenAI, etc.)

**Usage**: Add to test files that make external API calls for transcription or memory extraction:

```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Full Pipeline Integration Test
    [Documentation]    Complete end-to-end test with transcription and memory extraction
    [Tags]    e2e	requires-api-keys
    [Timeout]    600s

    # This test will be excluded from PR runs
    # It will run on dev/main branches with API keys
```

### When to Use `requires-api-keys`

**Add this tag when tests:**
- Require actual transcription (Deepgram or other STT providers)
- Require memory extraction with LLM (OpenAI, Ollama with real inference)
- Verify transcript quality against ground truth
- Test end-to-end pipeline with real API integration

**Do NOT add this tag when tests:**
- Test API endpoints (CRUD operations, permissions, etc.)
- Test infrastructure (worker management, queue operations)
- Test system health and readiness
- Can work with mock/stub services

### Test Execution Modes

**1. No-API Tests (PR runs)**
```bash
# Excludes tests tagged with requires-api-keys
cd tests
./run-no-api-tests.sh
```
- Uses `configs/mock-services.yml`
- No external API calls
- Fast feedback (~10-15 minutes)
- Runs ~70% of test suite

**2. Full Tests with API Keys (dev/main runs)**
```bash
# Runs all tests including API-dependent ones
cd tests
./run-robot-tests.sh
```
- Uses `configs/deepgram-openai.yml`
- Requires DEEPGRAM_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- Comprehensive validation (~20-30 minutes)
- Runs 100% of test suite

**3. Label-Triggered PR Tests**
- Add label `test-with-api-keys` to PR
- Triggers full test suite before merge
- Useful for testing API integration changes

### Mock Services Configuration

For tests that don't require API keys, use the mock services config:

**File**: `tests/configs/mock-services.yml`

**Features**:
- Disables external transcription and LLM services
- Keeps core services operational (MongoDB, Redis, Qdrant)
- No API keys required
- Fast test execution

**Use Cases**:
- Endpoint testing (auth, permissions, CRUD)
- Infrastructure testing (workers, queues)
- System health monitoring
- Local development without API keys

### Writing Tests for API Separation

**Good Example - Endpoint Test (No API Keys)**:
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
User Can Create and Delete Conversations
    [Documentation]    Test conversation CRUD without transcription
    [Tags]    conversation

    ${session}=    Get Admin API Session
    ${conversation}=    Create Test Conversation    ${session}
    ${deleted}=    Delete Conversation    ${session}    ${conversation}[id]
    Should Be True    ${deleted}
```

**Good Example - Integration Test (Requires API Keys)**:
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Audio Upload Produces Quality Transcript
    [Documentation]    Verify transcription quality with ground truth
    [Tags]    e2e	requires-api-keys

    ${conversation}=    Upload Audio File    ${TEST_AUDIO_FILE}
    Verify Transcription Quality    ${conversation}    ${EXPECTED_TRANSCRIPT}
    Verify Memory Extraction    ${conversation}
```

### GitHub Workflows

**Three workflows handle test execution:**

1. **`robot-tests.yml`** (PR - No API Keys)
   - Triggers: All pull requests
   - Execution: Excludes `requires-api-keys` tests
   - No secrets required

2. **`full-tests-with-api.yml`** (Dev/Main - Full Suite)
   - Triggers: Push to dev/main branches
   - Execution: All tests including API-dependent
   - Requires: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY

3. **`pr-tests-with-api.yml`** (PR - Label Triggered)
   - Triggers: PR with `test-with-api-keys` label
   - Execution: Full test suite before merge
   - Requires: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY

### Tag Guidelines for API Separation

**File-Level Tagging**:
- Tag entire test files that require API keys
- If ANY test in the file needs APIs, mark the whole file
- Simpler maintenance than per-test tagging

**Multiple Tags**:
- Use tab-separated tags (see `tags.md`)
- Example: `[Tags]    e2e	requires-api-keys`
- Always include primary component tag (e2e, conversation, memory)

**Tag Statistics**:
- `requires-api-keys`: ~1-2 test files (integration_test.robot)
- Most tests: No API requirements
- See `tests/tags.md` for complete tag list

### Local Development

**Running Tests Locally Without API Keys**:
```bash
cd tests
./run-no-api-tests.sh
```
- Works without any API key configuration
- Fast feedback for most development
- Tests endpoint logic and infrastructure

**Running Full Tests Locally**:
```bash
# Set API keys
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxx
export OPENAI_API_KEY=yyy

cd tests
./run-robot-tests.sh
```
- Validates full pipeline integration
- Tests transcription and memory extraction
- Use before pushing to dev/main

## Slow and SDK Test Organization

Chronicle excludes certain tests from default test runs to provide faster feedback and cleaner test execution.

### The `slow` Tag

**Purpose**: Mark tests that require long timeouts (>30s) or infrastructure operations like service restarts.

**Add this tag when tests:**
- Restart backend or other services (stop/start cycles)
- Test connection resilience after service failures
- Require timeouts longer than 30 seconds
- Test infrastructure operations that significantly slow down test execution

**Do NOT add this tag when tests:**
- Complete within normal timeouts (<30s)
- Don't restart or rebuild services
- Are simple endpoint or integration tests

**Example:**
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Test Job Persistence Through Backend Restart
    [Documentation]    Test that RQ jobs persist when backend service restarts
    [Tags]    queue	slow
    [Timeout]    120s

    ${job_id}=    Reprocess Transcript    ${conversation_id}
    Restart Backend Service    wait_timeout=90s    # Longer timeout for slow test
    ${jobs_after}=    Get job queue
    Should Be True    ${jobs_count_after} >= 0
```

**Running Slow Tests:**
```bash
cd tests

# Default test run (EXCLUDES slow tests)
make test         # Faster feedback, no service restarts

# Run ONLY slow tests
make test-slow    # Explicit slow test execution

# Run ALL tests including slow
make test-all-with-slow-and-sdk
```

### The `sdk` Tag

**Purpose**: Mark tests for unreleased SDK functionality that should be excluded until the SDK is published.

**Add this tag when tests:**
- Test SDK client library features
- Require SDK installation or SDK-specific imports
- Are for SDK features not yet released to users
- Test SDK authentication, upload, or retrieval methods

**Do NOT add this tag when tests:**
- Test backend API endpoints directly (these should always run)
- Test features available through direct HTTP/WebSocket calls
- Are part of the core backend functionality

**Example:**
```robot
*** Test Cases ***
SDK Can Upload Audio File
    [Documentation]    Test SDK audio upload functionality
    [Tags]    audio-upload	sdk

    ${result}=    Run Process    uv    run    python
    ...    ${CURDIR}/../scripts/sdk_test_upload.py
    ...    ${BACKEND_URL}    ${ADMIN_EMAIL}    ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}    ${test_audio}
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${result.rc}    0
```

**Running SDK Tests:**
```bash
cd tests

# Default test run (EXCLUDES sdk tests)
make test         # SDK not released yet

# Run ONLY SDK tests (when developing SDK)
make test-sdk

# Run ALL tests including SDK
make test-all-with-slow-and-sdk
```

**When to Re-enable SDK Tests:**
Once the SDK is released and published:
1. Remove `--exclude sdk` from default Makefile target (`make test`)
2. Keep the `sdk` tag for organization (allows filtering SDK-specific tests)
3. Update `tests/README.md` to reflect that SDK tests are included

### Benefits of Excluding Slow and SDK Tests

**Faster Default Test Runs:**
- Default `make test` excludes slow tests (service restarts, long timeouts)
- Provides faster feedback during development (saves 2-5 minutes per run)
- Developers can iterate quickly on endpoint and integration tests

**Cleaner Test Reports:**
- SDK tests won't fail in CI when SDK isn't released yet
- No confusing failures for unreleased features
- Clear separation of released vs unreleased functionality

**Explicit Execution When Needed:**
- Run slow tests explicitly when testing infrastructure resilience
- Run SDK tests explicitly when developing SDK features
- Full test suite available via `make test-all-with-slow-and-sdk`

### Tag Combination Examples

```robot
# Good - Slow infrastructure test
[Tags]    queue	slow
[Timeout]    120s

# Good - Unreleased SDK feature
[Tags]    audio-upload	sdk

# Good - Multiple component tags
[Tags]    conversation	memory

# Bad - Don't combine slow and sdk (different purposes)
[Tags]    slow	sdk
```
