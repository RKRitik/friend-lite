Documentation    GPU-based ASR Integration Tests - requires NVIDIA GPU
...
...              These tests validate actual transcription with real ASR models:
...              - Transformers/VibeVoice model loading and inference
...              - Transcription quality (actual text output)
...              - Word timestamp accuracy and ordering
...
...              IMPORTANT: These tests require:
...              - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
...              - Model download (~2-5GB first time)
...
...              The tests automatically start/stop the ASR service.
...              Run with: make test-asr-gpu
...              Excluded from default runs (requires-gpu tag)
