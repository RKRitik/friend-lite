Documentation    ASR Service Protocol Tests - validates API endpoints and response formats
...
...              These tests validate the ASR service API contract without requiring GPU.
...              They use the mock ASR server to verify:
...              - Health endpoint structure and response
...              - Info endpoint structure and response
...              - Transcribe endpoint accepts audio files
...              - Response format matches expected schema
